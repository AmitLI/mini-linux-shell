## mini-linux-shell

In this project, I built a simple shell under the Linux operating system.

The shell will show a prompt to the user, read the commands and send them to the operating system to execute them.

During the project I learned:
  * Writing a complex project in a modular and efficient way.       
  * Create processes that work simultaneously using fork ().     
  * Enable process communication while redirecting their input and output through dup2 ().     
  * Using many useful functions in C language
